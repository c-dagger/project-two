      <h2>That's my dawg!</h2>
      <p>
        This little cutie named Carson is a 2 1/2 year old Lab-Hound mix... and
        he is the love of my life. My girlfriend Lauren and I rescued Carson in
        January 2020 on a whim. We both were dying to get a dog of our own but
        neither of our apartments allowed animals. So, naturally, we decided to
        start looking for a home to move into together that allowed us to have a
        dog. However, we made the colossal mistake of visiting the rescue
        shelter before we secured a home. That's when we met Carson.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the idea rose to get a dog, we knew without a doubt that the only
        way we  were going to get one was to rescue one. We have a strong belief
        that there are enough animals  that are kept in cages with no homes, no
        where to go, many times given to kill shelters. Any way we could avoid
        that life for even one dog, we were going to take that opportunity  to
        change their life. Carson took Lauren and I both by surprise. Despite
        our anticipation of going to the rescue shelter, we were not expecting
        to fall in love with any pup at the first shelter, the first day we ever
        even scouted for one. But there he was.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember there were three sections of dogs of all breeds, of all ages.
        I remember not wanting to leave that day until I saved one of them, if
        not all of them. Then I felt a gentle little paw reach out and glide my
        arm as I walked by and my heart instantly melted. I look over to see the
        cutest puppy dog eyes I've ever laid eyes on looking at me with his paw
        extended as an invitation to simply be noticed and be greeted. How could
        I walk away? There was no way in Hell I was leaving here without him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rescue shelter was very accommodating and allowed us to spend time
        with him outside on a leash with treats and toys. The coolest part, we
        quickly discovered he already knew some tricks like paw, sit, and how
        to jump up to our chests! He was the sweetest boy with his gentle nudges
        for head rubs, gratefulness for treats, and his comical soft bark that
        shows his inner Hound. It's hilarious, actually, we poke fun all the
        time saying he sounds like someone impersonating a dog barking. Family
        and friends many times refer to him as the 'Woo-er' and often show off
        their impressively similar impressions of his bark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carson is truly one of a kind. So special to us, in fact, that we
        expedited our search and securement of a home within two days of meeting
        him so that we did not lose the opportunity to make him part of our
        family.
