    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <article id="aboutme">
        <h3>Student</h3>
        <p>
          I am a Graduate student in the Information Technology and Management
          Program at Illinois Institute of Technology. Previously graduated with
          a Bachelor of Business Management and Marketing at University of
          Wisconsin - Parkside.
        </p>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>
          Yes I am a Dugger. No I am not related to the family on the TLC show
          "19 Kids and Counting". Although, I am the oldest of five and my youngest
          sibling is 18 years my junior. We're not your average family, but we
          definitely do not disappoint!
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew as the pack leader in my family with each sibling after me 4 to
          5 years apart from each other. We were told by family and friends
          growing up that it looked like we were coming out of a clown car when
          we arrived anywhere. I guess our teachers probably felt the same as we
          are all going to enter high school the year after the previous one of
          us graduated. The order would go: myself (graduated 2011), Zach
          (2015), Jacob (2019), Mackenzie (2024), and Ryleigh (2029).
        </p>
        <p>
          We grew up all really close whether it was playing sports, helping
          each other with school, playing pranks at home, or growing up at our
          campground. Ironically, we actually have a golf cart train that is
          absolutely necessary for us to get around our campground together. We
          call it the "Chugga Dugga Train" as it sounds like a train. We still
          hold this tradition close to our hearts as we get older and try to
          make it up to our camper as often as possible. My mom and dad still go
          every weekend and have successfully convinced several other friends
          and family members to get their own campsites to keep them company.
          Like I mentioned before, never a dull moment. My parents married young
          and recently celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary. I am lucky to
          be so close to them and am also now at that stage in life where my mom
          refers to my dad as "Phil" instead of "Your Dad" and I am more of a
          best friend, but I wouldn't change our relationship for the world.

        <h3>Fun</h3>
          <h4>Camping</h4>
          <p>
            My family and I have gone camping since I was a little girl. Over
            the years, we have evolved from borrowed tents, to our own tents, to
            a pop-up trailer, to a stationary trailer, to what we have now - an
            RV trailer. My parents are avid campers so I have always cherished
            the idea of family time outdoors, with limited cell phone
            connection. There is no better feeling than listening to 80s rock,
            making smores in your favorite hoodie, going on a late night golf
            cart ride by the beach, and cracking jokes with your family by the
            campfire.
          </p>
          <h4>Travelling</h4>
          <p>
            Travelling is one of the greatest thrills in my life. I try to go to
            at least one destination vacation a year. I love travelling because
            it is a reality check that bursts our every day bubble. It is a
            notion that there  is so much more to life than just our immediate
            surroundings, our every day stressors. It is hope and courage  that
            you can always change your life and move in a new direction,
            literally. Travelling teaches us to be humble and  grateful for what
            we have and to remind us that life is too short to stress on the
            little things.
          </p>
          <h4>Record Collecting</h4>
            <p>
              Music has always kept me grounded through every stage in life. I
              listen to music, dance to music, or even break out into song
              multiple times a day on a regular basis. It's quite entertaining.
              Recently, I picked up a 7 in 1 Victrola Turntable to play records
              on. I love all genres of music but majority of my favorite music
              can be found on classic records. Something about the tangibility
              of having that record in my hands, being able to change it
              manually, putting that needle on the vinyl so carefully separates
              the feeling so far from playing it somewhere digitally by clicking
              a button.
            </p>
